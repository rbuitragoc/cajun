The invading force of the neighboring Remorans had taken the peaceful planet by surprise and decimated the army. Only a few brave remained and they formed the resistance of Solaria."},{"author":"zurdus","story":"The night had started to fall upon these men, as Dorax, last remnant of the Royal Family and _de facto_ leader of the resistance, walked around them trying to alleviate with hot bowls of broth what could only be achieved with freedom and justice.\n\n\"_Here we are, the last line of defense of great Kingdom of Solaria..._\" said Dorax to himself, while the last batch of broth disappeared into the eager hands of an elderly fellow. Most of these men, simple refugees running from the violence the remorans had brought upon them, had little experience on matters of war. If they could only bring back the Shield of the King. Those brave men and women, always loyal to the kingdom, had given all their lives making sure Dorax escaped unharmed.  _But what good am I right here? Hiding like a rat?_ He asked himself grimly. He might as well sell himself as a slave to the Artix Federation and work in one of their mine planets for the coin he needed to feed the ever-growing refugee camp. They were his kingdom now."}]},{"name":"The rise of lol","pin":3,"fragments":[]}]}
